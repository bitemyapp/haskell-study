Inspiration and Initial Steps
=============================

My interest in wanting to study Haskell started with [this blog post](http://techblog.realestate.com.au/the-abject-failure-of-weak-typing/).    Despite the inflamatory title, I found myself agreeing with several of the points listed.  What's more, the dynamic-type enthusiasts around the internets did a poor job refuting the arguments in my opinion.  I decided to dig into Haskell with an open mind to see what's the what.  These posts are going to document my steps taken to learn Haskell.

## My Background

I program professionally in Java, which is statically typed, but if you spend 5 minutes reading anything written by a Haskell enthusiast about Java, you'll gather that Java's type system is anemic.  They hint at a much deeper experience in Haskell.  I write most of my personal projects in dynamic languages: Python and some Clojure.  What I like most about these 2 languages is the focus on simplicity and readability, and the ability to get things done quickly.  I have no idea how Haskell stacks up here.

## The Path

1. Install [Haskell for Mac OS X](http://exercism.io).
2. Start working through Brent Yorgey's [Haskell Course](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/%7Ecis194/lectures.html).
3. Do the Haskell problems on [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io).

## The Goal

The goal is to complete the Yorgey course, complete the problems on Exercism.io, and become confident enough to start thinking in Haskell and to start buildinging side projects with it.

I'm interested in seeing how Haskell challenges/changes my views.  I've tried several courses online before and usually give up after a starry-eyed start.  Maybe posting these here publicly will help push me to finish.
