## Reading

- Read [Week 1](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/lectures/01-intro.html) of CIS194
- Read Chapters [1](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/getting-started.html) and [2](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/types-and-functions.html) of Real World Haskell

What was covered:

- Lots of buzzwords (functional, pure, referential transparency, immunitability, laziness)
- The importance of using types, abstraction, and wholemeal programming
- Basic ghci usage
- How to declare and define variables
- Basic types:  integers, floats, booleans, characters, strings, 
- pairs and lists
- arithmetic manipulation of the above, boolean logic, comparisons
- functions: sqrt, succ, pred, sin, truncate, round, floor, ceiling

## Haskell to English

    x :: Int  -- x is of type Int
    x = 3     -- x is defined to be 3
    y = ['a'] -- y is defined to be a list containing elements of type Char

I'll probably be writing down any of these I see, just to drill it into my head.

## Gripes
CIS194 notes that the page you are reading is a literate program, and asks you to modify code in the document to see what happens, but doesn't tell you how you should do this.  The .lhs file is linked to on the index page, but what are you supposed to do with it?  I tried to run it through ghc and got an error, then realized you are supposed to load it with ghci.  Once I figured this out, things became clearer.  The text asks you to enter expressions like "_ex01 = 3 + 2_" in ghci.  This results in an error since you have to define variables with _let_ in ghci.  I didn't grok this until I read the other sources.  This is probably my fault since I didn't do the Suggested Reading first.

Some of the ghci session output in Real World Haskell did not match the output of my environment since they are different versions (RWH was published in 2008).  This might have been confusing if I was only using the one book as a source.  Encountering differences like this while you are trying to build solid foundations to stand on is frustrating.
