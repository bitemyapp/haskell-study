Inspiration and Initial Steps
=============================

My interest in wanting to study Haskell started with [this blog post](http://techblog.realestate.com.au/the-abject-failure-of-weak-typing/).    Despite the inflamatory name, I found myself agreeing with several of the points listed.  What's more, the dynamic-type enthusiasts around the internets did a poor job refuting the arguments in my opinion.  I decided to dig into Haskell with an open mind to see what the big deal is.

## My Background

I program professionally in Java, which is statically typed, but if you spend 5 minutes reading anything written by a Haskell enthusiast about Java, you'll gather that its type system is anemic.  I write most of my personal projects in dynamic languages: Python and some Clojure.  What I like most about these 2 languages are the focus on simplicity and readability, and the ability to get things done quickly.

## The Path

1. Install [Haskell for Mac OS X](http://exercism.io).
2. Start working through Brent Yorgey's [Haskell Course](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/%7Ecis194/lectures.html).
3. Do the Haskell problems on [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io).

## The Goal

The goal is to complete the Yorgey course, complete the problems on Exercism.io, and become confident enough to start thinking in Haskell and to start buildinging side projects with it.

I've tried several courses online before and usually give up.  We'll see what happens.
