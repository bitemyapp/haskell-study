## Reading

[Why Functional Programming Matters](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf) by John Hughes.

Key takeaways:

- Modular design helps with programming in the large.
- Functional programmers should strive to make smaller, simpler, more general modules.
- In order to build modules, functional languages provide 2 kinds of glue:
	1. **Higher Order Functions** enable simple functions to be glued togther to make more complex ones.
	2. **Lazy Evaluation** enables whole programs to be glued together.
